This notebook contains an example of training a neural network using TensorFlow and Python, then running it in the browser using TensorFlow.js. 

This notebook provides example code to do the following:

1. Train a neural network using Python to classify flowers
1. Save the model to disk
1. Convert the model to TensorFlow.js format
1. Create a webpage using a minimum amount of HTML and JavaScript to run the model
1. Serve the webpage from this notebook (instructions are also provided to serve the page locally)
1. Upload images through the UI and classify them with the model
